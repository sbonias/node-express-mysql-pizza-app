## Description

A full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS as well as Handlebars and use of css animations, and a back end implemented with Node.js and Express. The user may enter a pizza of their liking into the input box and create it by simply clicking the submit button at which point the new pizza entry is added into a MySql database and is further displayed under the Pizzas Ordered section. The user may then devour a pizza by selecting the corresponding button, which will move the burger to the adjacent Devoured Pizza section and further update it's status within MySql from a non-devoured to a devoured status.
